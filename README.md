TypeScript Handbook
===================

The code examples and topics in this handbook are gathered from various sources to give (or learn) TypeScript in more detail.

Glossary:
------
- tsc = TypeScript CLI
- TS = TypeScript
- WBAS = will be added soon (as I progress with my learning goals)

What is TypeScript?
------

From their official website:

`TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.`

_**This is actually correct**. I cannot define all the features it offers without you (yourself) exploring it in depth._

Pros & Cons
------
These are the first few things comes to my mind when I think about TS.

Pros:

- Type checking
- OOP
- Best of both worlds (front end and back end)
- Can be use with most of the latest JS frameworks/libraries.
- Amazingly superb with growing source code.
- ES6 features? Indeed TS supports all those new features.

Cons:
- A bit of hassle in integration (tho latest tools offer TS integration out of the box).
- Can increase development time if not being used with proper type structuring approach.


When should we use it?
------
WBAS

I will write my opinion here once I get myself more familiar with the use cases of TS.

Why am I learning it?
------
I will be honest here, someone asked me how much do you know about TypeScript, and I said enough to work with it (and that was my mistake :) ).

Then he asked me few things related to TS and MAN!! he actually made me realize that I am no where near a person who can utilize this amazing tech and develop super amazing stuff.

The more I explore it, the more I find it fascinating.
