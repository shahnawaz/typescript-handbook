Why am I learning it?

I will be honest here, someone asked me how much do you know about TypeScript, and I said enough to work with it (and this was my mistake :) ).

Then he asked me few things related to TS and MAN!!!! he actually made me realize that I am no where near a person who can utilize this amazing tech and develop super amazing stuff.
